      The classes in this package implement the output of an TreeGraph 2 document with <code>Graphics2D</code>. All 
      elements of a document are first positioned by positioner class and than painted by a painter class. 
      Positioners and painters are used to display a tree in the document window as well as for the graphic export. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Different positioners and painters exist for each view mode which can accessed by the 
      <code>PositionPaintFactory</code>. The implementation follows the abstract strategy pattern.
